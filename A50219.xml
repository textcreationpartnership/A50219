            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE ſhall pretermit what the <hi>Conſiderators</hi> have in their <hi>Scandalous Libel</hi> related concerning other Plantations, and only take notice of what concerns <hi>New-England.</hi> And in the firſt place they affirm,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That hundreds of Ships have been Employed to tranſport thence Tobacco, Sugars, Wooll and other Materials for Manufactures, into</hi> France, Holland; <hi>and to import thence into</hi> New-England, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, Woollen and all other Manufactures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This at firſt View will appear a great Untruth to all that know <hi>New-England;</hi> for that Countrey can hardly expend the Goods that are yearly Exported from hence thither, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the People conſidered; nor have they any other way to vend ſo great a quantity of Goods as ſuch a Number of Ships muſt neceſſarily Import: Nor have they Commodities

               </gap>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:33761:3"/>to Export fit for thoſe parts, nor could they (all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered) purchaſe Goods thence on ſo eaſie terms as they may have them from <hi>England.</hi> And they have made a <hi>Law againſt Exporting of Wooll,</hi> not having a twentieth part of what is neceſſary for their own Uſe. The moſt of their Shipping is employed in tranſporting Lumber, Horſes and Proviſions to <hi>Jamaica, Barbados,</hi> and the <hi>Caribbee Iſlands,</hi> without which thoſe Iſlands cannot well ſubſiſt: And many Veſſels are built there upon Account of Merchants in <hi>London,</hi> ſent home, and by them often ſold or employed here: And to prevent Illegal practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they made in the Year 1663. a Law, That <hi>the Act of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation</hi> ſhould be ſtrictly obſerved; and their Governours have been carefull to ſee it Executed, and are yearly Sworn ſo to doe; nor can it be proved, that the leaſt Breach of it was ever allowed by the Government, which is not to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the private Tranſgreſſions of ſome few particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>As for what the <hi>Conſiderators</hi> report, concerning the Manner of Vacating the Charter of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Colony, the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is by them fallaciouſly repreſented. When a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> was in the Year 1683. iſſued out againſt them, with the Notification thereof: By the then Kings Order were ſent over one hundred Copies of the proceedings againſt the Charter of <hi>London,</hi> and two hundred Copies of a Declaration, to be diſperſed among the People in <hi>New-England,</hi> diſcharging the Inhabitants from all Rates and Contributions towards the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the ſaid Suit, and enjoyning thoſe particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons mentioned in the <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> to make their Defence at their own particular Charge, without any help by a publick Stock.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs the Governour and Company appointed an Attorney to Anſwer to the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> in the Court of <hi>Kings Bench;</hi> where it was let fall, and a new Suit Began by <hi>Scire Facias</hi> in Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> and Judgment entred againſt them for Default in not Appearing: Whereas, conſidering the Remoteneſs of <hi>New-England</hi> from <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to Appear in the time allowed, and ſo by a Surprize their Charter was taken from them.</p>
            <p>As to what is objected about <hi>Coyning,</hi> many Goldſmiths in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33761:3"/>
               <hi>London</hi> can teſtifie, that the Money coyned in <hi>New-England</hi> is as good as that of <hi>England,</hi> and not of a <hi>baſer Allay,</hi> (as is ſuggeſted.) It was formerly cuſtomary for private Perſons in <hi>England</hi> to Coyn Farthings for their own Uſe, and the Coyning in <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> Colony was little more than that, and with Deſign to prevent the great Injuries Merchants and others ſuſtained by baſe <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Money: And the Mint was ſet up in 1652. when there was no King in <hi>England,</hi> but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment out of Courſe; and when the ancient Government of <hi>England</hi> was reſettled, and the Kings mind to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignified to them, they reſolved to comply therewith, though many wayes diſadvantageous to themſelves. Was not the Value of Coyn altered in <hi>Penſilvania?</hi> Did not the Lord <hi>Baltimore</hi> in <hi>Maryland,</hi> Coyn Money with his own Image on one ſide, and his Coat of Arms on the other? Did not the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company? But when they underſtood ther Error, they petitioned the King for liberty of Coynage, and pardon of what was paſt, and it was granted them? Why then ſhould <hi>New-England</hi> be eſteemed more criminal than other Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſiderators</hi> go on, and complain, That in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> they have <hi>Impoſed Taxes upon Shipping and the Manufactures of</hi> England <hi>coming into thoſe parts.</hi> There hath been <hi>none</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on Shipping but <hi>Powder-Money,</hi> and not half ſo much as is done in the other Plantations, nor any upon the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of <hi>England</hi> particularly, but only one penny upon Twenty ſhillings Value of all Merchandizes whatſoever, as on all other Eſtates in the Countrey; and ſince Charters were taken from them, the ſame and more hath been levied by the preſent Governour, beſides ſix times the Fees upon Shipping more than was paid formerly: All which hath been done by him without any conſent of the People, or their Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, which the former Government never practiſed.</p>
            <p>Whereas it is maliciouſly inſinuated, That the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> have Impoſed an Oath of Fidelity to their Common-wealth, we ſhall only in Anſwer Inſert the Copy of the Oath, as it is in their printed Law-book.</p>

            <p>Nor know we that they have (as is aſſerted) <hi>Encroached upon their Neighbouring Colonies in a hoſtile manner,</hi> except it be meant of their Aſſiſting with Voluntiers when King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second ſent to take <hi>Monhatas,</hi> now called <hi>New-York;</hi> or of their Concurrence in taking from the <hi>French,</hi> S. <hi>Johns, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobſcot, Port Royal,</hi> which were put into the hands of thoſe that were then in Power in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor have they (as is alledged) <hi>Affronted the Commiſſioners of King</hi> Charles <hi>the Second;</hi> whoſe Commiſſion (as to the legal part of it, not by them duly obſerved) was in ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars Illegal and Arbitrary, and Empowred them to <hi>Hear and determine all Cauſes</hi> (not by Law, but) <hi>according to their ſound Diſcretion;</hi> which could not be ſubmitted to by the <hi>Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſets,</hi> without giving up at once their Charter and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges.</p>
            <p>Neither have they <hi>made Laws againſt all Opinions in Religion, excepting thoſe of the Congregational Churches, and more eſpecially againſt the Church of</hi> England. It muſt be acknowledged, that there have been ſome ſevere and unjuſtifiable Laws there, in

                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> long ſince ſenſible; yet what is here affirmed, is untrue; for <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have equal Encouragement with thoſe of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational perſwaſion:</hi> Nor are there any <hi>Laws againſt the Church of</hi> England, as is falſly and malitiouſly pretended. Let them prove if they can, that any number of Men inclined to worſhip God, in the way of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> were denyed by the Government in <hi>New-England</hi> liberty ſo to do. The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates there have often profeſſed, that they would not hinder any that were ſo principled from practiſing what they did moſt approve of.</p>
            <p>As for their <hi>Treating ill the Captains of the Kings Ships for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring Permiſſion to recruit themſelves with Men and Victuals; and as to entertaining of Pirats:</hi> Theſe things are like the former. If any Commanders of Ships have behaved themſelves Inſolently, and violated the Laws of God and the Land, it became the Government to teſtifie againſt them; but malice it ſelf cannot deny, that the People of <hi>New-England</hi> have been extreamly Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to Strangers, and eſpecially to ſuch as the King hath put any mark of Honour upon; and they have ſometimes relieved, and that <hi>Gratis,</hi> the Kings Ships diſtreſſed through want of Proviſion: And if any <hi>Pirats</hi> have been entertained, it hath been becauſe they were not known to be ſuch; for they made a particular Law againſt Piracy, agreeable to the Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> on account whereof ſome have been there Executed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſiderators</hi> tell us, that the People of <hi>New-England</hi> are <hi>free from all Taxes, and Contribute nothing to the Crown, nor their own Protection or Support:</hi> Whereas they are no more free than other Plantations, for they pay Cuſtoms in the Plantations for the Goods they fetch thence into <hi>New-England;</hi> and when thoſe Goods are brought into <hi>England,</hi> they pay the ſame a ſecond time; ſo that they Contribute not a little to the Crown. Before the change of their Government, they never did put the Crown to a penny Charge for their Protection or Support: but ſince that, have been very chargeable, and leſs beneficial to the Crown.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange, that the Conſiderators ſhould have the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to publiſh to the World, <hi>That the People of New-England in General, are better ſatisfied with the preſent Government there, and do not</hi>

            <p>All the Charters of <hi>New-England,</hi> one only excepted, are ſtill in force; there having been no Judgment againſt them, nor Surrender of them made or Recorded; and by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they have Power to chooſe their own Governours and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, as much as any Towns Corporate, or Cities here in <hi>England,</hi> have Power to chooſe their own Maior and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen. Beſides, muſt thoſe Colonies in <hi>New-England,</hi> be the only ones excepted from Indempnity, and all other Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſuppoſed to have been without fault? And muſt they alone remain ſorrowful for the loſs of what is ſo valuable to them? who at their own vaſt Charges, and great Hazards ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued a Wilderneſs, and with the loſs of many hundreds of their Lives, have maintained and defended it, to the enlargment of the Kings Dominions; hoping, as in Reaſon they might, that their Poſterity ſhould enjoy the benefit thereof? So that to deprive them of their Charters, is to deal more hardly, than to do the like with any Bodies Politick in <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>As to the other Pamphlet newly come forth, called, <hi>An Abſtract of Laws in</hi> New-England, <hi>not agreeable with the Laws of</hi> England: The firſt Law they take notice of, is a Fiction of their own, the reſt were moſt of them long ſince repealed; yea, all that were inconvenient, or eſteemed repugnant to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Conſiderators</hi> (whom we muſt needs ſuppoſe to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the Abſtract) if ever they read the <hi>New-England</hi> Laws, could not be ignorant that the Word <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> ſo much complain'd of, was repealed and obliterated, and the Word <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> inſerted inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>As for the Remarks which they make thereon, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the Ebullitions of a ſpiteful Spirit, and ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly falſe, as that we think it not worth the while to recite, much leſs to refute them.</p>
